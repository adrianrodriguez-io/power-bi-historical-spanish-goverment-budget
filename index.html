<h1>Power Bi - EDA Spanish PGE Analysis</h1>
<h3>Data visualization:</h3>
<p>
Data visualization developed with Power Bi about historical data of the Spanish PGE estimations for different years.
Originally the data is based in the PDFs documents, wich are a little bit confusing, but wich have been
converted into csv format thanks to the team of <a href='https://www.dondevanmisimpuestos.es'>https://www.dondevanmisimpuestos.es</a> who worked 
on a ruby application that ingest PDFs and 
generate the data in csv format. 

You can find the original ruby project and the csv files in the following Github repository 
<a href='https://github.com/civio/scraper-pge/'>https://github.com/civio/scraper-pge/</a>
</p>
<h3>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insights:</h3>
<p>
In the EDA analysis we can find that there are not very many huge increments or decreases over the years. 
In the data visualization we can find that main items of expenses are transfers, families expenses items 
and retirements transfers in the top 3 list.
Taking a look at incomes we can find that the estimation is supported by the following 3 items, direct taxes, 
social labour taxation and general taxation (cotizaciones generales). 
Disclaimer: I have to say that I am not familiarized with the terms used in the Spanish governement budget
but i thought it would interesting to do an EDA about the data.

<h3>Data modeling:</h3>
<p>The data modeling for this project consists on 4 tables: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tipo: wich contains the two members, Gastos and Incomes, for filtering.</li>
<li>Ejercicio: wich contains a relation of the years analyzed.</li>
<li>Gastos: A set of different tables with same structure containing data 
about estimated expenses for different years.
In the data model of the Power Bi these different tables have been merged into one dataset.</li>
<li>Ingresos: A set of tables for the different years analyzed with about estimated incomes. 
In the data model of the Power BI these different tables have been merged into one dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relations between the different tables can be seen in the following image.</p>

<h3>Data visualization:</h3>
<p>As following you can find the data visualization wich is a Power BI wich allow you to interact
and explore the data.</p>
