# Power BI Spanish goverment historical budget
Data visualization developed with Power Bi about historical data of the Spanish PGE estimations for different years.

Originally the data is based in the PDFs documents, wich are a little bit confusing, but wich have been
converted into csv format thanks to the team of <a href='https://www.dondevanmisimpuestos.es'>https://www.dondevanmisimpuestos.es</a> who worked 
on a ruby application that ingest PDFs and 
generate the data in csv format. 

You can find the original ruby project and the csv files in the following Github repository 
<a href='https://github.com/civio/scraper-pge/'>https://github.com/civio/scraper-pge/</a>
