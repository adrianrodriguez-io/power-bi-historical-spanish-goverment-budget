# power-bi-pgde
Data visualization developed with Power Bi about historical data of the Spanish PGE estimations for different years.

Originally the data is based in the PDFs documents, wich are a little bit confusing, but wich have been
converted into csv format thanks to the team of <a href='https://www.dondevanmisimpuestos.es'>https://www.dondevanmisimpuestos.es</a> who worked 
on a ruby application that ingest PDFs and 
generate the data in csv format. 

You can find the original ruby project and the csv files in the following Github repository
